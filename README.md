# Pac-Man Game

## Overview
This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game, developed using the Swing library for the graphical interface. Players control Pac-Man, navigating a maze to collect pellets while avoiding ghosts. The game includes features such as movement, collision detection, scoring, and ghost AI.

## Features
- **Maze Navigation**: Allows the player to control Pac-Man's movement within a maze.
- **Ghost AI**: Ghosts roam the maze, adding a layer of challenge as the player avoids them.
- **Scoring System**: Collecting pellets increases the playerâ€™s score.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when Pac-Man collides with a ghost.
- **Customizable Board**: The board size and tile dimensions are configurable.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Uses object-oriented principles for game entities and state management.
- **Swing Framework**: Manages the GUI, including the maze, character sprites, and score display.
- **Event Handling**: Captures keyboard inputs for controlling Pac-Man and managing game events.
- **Randomized Elements**: Adds variety to ghost behavior and gameplay dynamics.

## Files
- **App.java**: The entry point of the application, which initializes the game window and sets up the `PacMan` class.
- **PacMan.java**: Contains the primary game logic, including movement controls, collision detection, ghost behavior, and rendering of the maze and characters.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name.git
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac App.java PacMan.java
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java App

## How to Play:
Use the arrow keys to control Pac-Man's movement through the maze.
Avoid the ghosts as you collect pellets to increase your score.
The game ends if a ghost catches Pac-Man.
